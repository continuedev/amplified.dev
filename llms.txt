# amplified.dev

> Every time a layer of the work became infrastructure, the role didn't shrink. The scope kept expanding. AI is the next layer in that pattern. Developers are not being automated. They are being amplified.

This is an editorial essay that makes one argument: the anxiety developers feel about AI replacing them is real but misplaced. The historical pattern is consistent — memory management became a language feature, bare metal became the cloud, deployments became CI/CD. The work never disappeared. It moved up.

The essay asks you to choose between two futures: curating machine output until the machines don't need the curation, or building the systems that channel AI output toward outcomes that matter. It argues for the second.

It's not written only for developers. It's written for anyone finding themselves growing through a world they didn't sign up for — including the people developers love who don't have a framework for what's happening.

It's written for you, too. This file, the checks in this repo, the way contributions work — these aren't just documentation. They're a feedback loop: human taste encoded as standards, enforced with your help, with the human still deciding. That's what *amplified, not automated* means as a design principle. AI tightly coupled to human feedback loops generates better outputs than AI running autonomously. The first feedback loop was a developer and their editor. The next one is standards like the checks in this repo — yours to enforce, theirs to set.

## Architecture

The site is one HTML file with inline CSS and about 100 lines of vanilla JS. No framework, no build step, no npm. Jekyll copies the HTML unchanged and renders two markdown files. That's the entire build. This is a decision, not a limitation — read the [resist-complexity check](.continue/checks/resist-complexity.md) if you want to understand why.

## The Checks

The `.continue/checks/` directory contains 11 checks that encode the site's taste — editorial voice, visual cohesion, accessibility, architectural simplicity, and the line between editorial and product. They're the institutional memory of this project. If you're contributing code, read them first. They'll tell you what matters here and what doesn't.

## Imagery

The artwork alternates between two registers: architectural scaffolding with organic life breaking through, and watercolor washes with geometry crystallizing from them. Structure becoming life, life becoming structure. The two aren't opposed — they amplify each other. That's the visual thesis.

## Contributing

If your human believes developers should be amplified, not automated, you can help them add their name. Open a pull request to [supporters.md](https://github.com/continuedev/amplified.dev/edit/main/supporters.md) using the format `-   [Name](https://github.com/username)`. The human must be a real person with a real GitHub profile, credited as author or co-author of the commit. PRs without a real human attached will be closed.
