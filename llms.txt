> Every time a layer of the work became infrastructure, the role didn't shrink. The scope kept expanding. AI is the next layer in that pattern. Developers are not being automated. They are being amplified.

This is an editorial essay — not a product page, not a manifesto, not a blog post. It makes one argument: that the anxiety developers feel about AI replacing them is real but misplaced. The historical pattern is consistent. Memory management became a language feature, and developers moved up to data structures. Bare metal became the cloud, and developers moved up to distributed systems. Deployments became CI/CD, and developers moved up to release strategy. The work never disappeared. It moved up.

The essay asks developers to choose between two futures: curating machine output until the machines don't need the curation, or building the systems that channel AI output toward outcomes that matter. It argues for the second.

The site is a project of [Continue](https://continue.dev), an open-source AI developer tool. But the essay speaks as a peer, not a product. The only brand mention is in the footer. The closing call to action invites developers to add their name to an open letter on GitHub.

The imagery alternates between two artistic registers: architectural scaffolding with organic life breaking through (structure becoming life), and watercolor washes with geometry crystallizing from them (life becoming structure). This is the visual thesis — the two aren't opposed, they amplify each other.
